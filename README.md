## New channels added

## MyTv

**Dynamic Source Search:** Adds functionality to search for new .m3u8 links using a search query.  
**Duplicate Detection:** Adds a mechanism to store and check for duplicates, so new channels are only added if theyâ€™re unique.  
**Scheduled Execution:** Sets up a scheduled task to run every 6 hours.  
  
*This workflow will keep IPTV .m3u file automatically updated and versioned in the repo.*
